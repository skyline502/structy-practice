max increasing subseq
Write a function, maxIncreasingSubseq, that takes in an array of numbers as an argument. The function should return the length of the longest subsequence of strictly increasing numbers.

A subsequence of an array can be created by deleting any elements of the array, while maintaining the relative order of elements.

test_00:
const numbers = [4, 18, 20, 10, 12, 15, 19];
maxIncreasingSubseq(numbers); // -> 5
test_01:
const numbers = [12, 9, 2, 5, 4, 32, 90, 20];
maxIncreasingSubseq(numbers); // -> 4
test_02:
const numbers = [42, 50, 51, 60, 55, 70, 4, 5, 70];
maxIncreasingSubseq(numbers); // -> 5
test_03:
const numbers = [7, 14, 10, 12];
maxIncreasingSubseq(numbers); // -> 3
test_04:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21];
maxIncreasingSubseq(numbers); // -> 21
test_05:
const numbers = [
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 6, 30, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 10, 18, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 100,
  104,
];
maxIncreasingSubseq(numbers); // -> 23
test_06:
const numbers = [
  1, 2, 300, 3, 4, 305, 5, 12, 6, 30, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 10, 15, 11, 12, 13, 10, 18, 14, 15, 16,
